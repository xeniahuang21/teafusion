                <div class="testimonial-text">
                    <p>In 2012, two health-conscious best friends- Kian and Odette came together to create an organic
                        tea brand that prioritized purity and flavor. They sourced the finest tea leaves from small
                        family-owned farms in India and blended them into unique, delicious combinations with the help
                        of some friends. </p>
                    <p>The brand gained popularity through word of mouth and social media, and soon became a household
                        name among tea lovers seeking a natural, refreshing beverage.</p>

                <h2>Our Values</h2>
                <p>Freshly brewed tea is the best way to experience the flavors of natureâ€™s finest ingredients. Our
                    organic herbal teas are hand-crafted using only the finest, ethically sourced ingredients and
                    steeped for lower temperatures to ensure optimal health benefits.</p>

                <p> We carefully choose each ingredient in our recipes to ensure they are ecologically sourced, fairly
                    traded, and organically grown. Our goal is to have as small an environmental impact as possible
                    while providing high-quality tea experiences for our customers. </p>

                <h2>Sourcing</h2>
                <p>At our tea company, we take pride in our organic process of brewing tea and the art of the delicate
                    infusion of tea leaves. We believe that brewing a perfect cup of tea is not just a process, but an
                    experience that should be savored and enjoyed. </p>

                    <p>We start by selecting only the finest, organic loose tea leaves from trusted sources around the
                    world. Our tea leaves are carefully selected for their unique flavor profiles, aroma, and
                    appearance.
